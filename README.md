# Dynamic URL Shortener Application

## Introduction
After completing JavaScript to write Firebase Cloud Functions, I started exploring Node.js. Using this, I crafted a dynamic URL shortener application using Express.js and MongoDB running in a Docker container. This versatile project is accessible via web, API, and a custom Discord Bot.

## Features
- Dynamic URL shortening
- Web interface
- RESTful API
- Discord Bot integration

## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Docker
- JWT authentication
- EJS for server-side rendering
- MVC architecture

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables.
4. Start the server: `npm start`.

## Usage
- Access the web interface at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- Use the API endpoints for programmatically shortening URLs.
- Integrate the Discord Bot with your Discord server for URL shortening functionality.

## Future Plans
Next, I'll learn TypeScript to build seamless Flutter applications using Node.js and Express.js as a backend, and MongoDB or PostgreSQL as a SQL database.

Cheers to the coding journey ahead!
